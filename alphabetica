// So for a job thing (which I'm allowed to ask for outside help for), I need to generate the alphabet one letter at a time. The extra trick is that every time the letter E shows up it needs to be represented by a 3. So the end result should look like this:
// 
// A 
// AB 
// ABC 
// ABCD 
// ABCD3 
// ABCD3F 
// ABCD3FG 
// ... 
// ABCD3FGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
// 
// I've gotten as far as generating a list of letters with the E replaced by a 3, but I'm stumped on how to generate a gradually longer string. I've been looking at conCat but that just creates ZZ at the end.
// 
for (i=65; i<91; i++) {
var res = String.fromCharCode(i);
if (i == 69) {
    console.log("3");
}
else
    console.log(res);
}
